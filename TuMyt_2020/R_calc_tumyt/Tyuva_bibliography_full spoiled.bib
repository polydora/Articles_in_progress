@article{baden2021declining,
abstract = {During the past 2-3 decades, the spatiotemporal distribution of Mytilus spp. in coastal waters of the North Atlantic has changed considerably. In general, reduced abundances of Mytilus are observed, but there is a great degree of local variation, and some areas are also experiencing recovery after declining events. In this review, hypotheses regarding the causes behind the changes are presented with focus on a Swedish perspective. Excessive exploitation of mussel banks combined with direct and indirect effects of climate change are most probably the main drivers of Mytilus spp. decline in large parts of the North Atlantic. On the Swedish west coast, the wild stocks have disappeared despite no overfishing. Paradoxically, they thrive in mussel farms and on other non-demersal substrates. Changes in predation from, for example, increased wintering populations of eiders (Somateria molissima; 10-fold) and green crabs (Carcinus maenas; 3-fold), alteration of natural substrates elicited by eutrophication, and exacerbated by climate change (increased sea surface temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events) are most likely the key factors for the decline. Most anthropogenic stressors may not be decisive by themselves, but combined effects can potentially be fatal to Mytilus spp. adults and larvae.},

abstract = {In this study we compared some aspects of the physiology of the invasive blue mussel species Mytilus trossulus and the native Mytilus edulis in the White Sea. We registered the heart activity of M. edulis, M. trossulus and the hybrids in situ for two years and tested their thermal tolerance in a laboratory experiment. In situ monitoring showed that the heart rate, as well as its variability, was greater in the invasive species and the hybrids than in the native mussel species. At the same time, the native species showed a higher thermal tolerance in the laboratory experiment. Our results suggest that, when it comes to adaptation to increased temperature, M. edulis has a greater physiological potential than M. trossulus. In a warming climate, the invasive species may lose in competition with the native one due to a higher level of metabolism.},

@article{begin2004macroalgal,
abstract = {We examined the invertebrate assemblages associated with macroalgal canopies in the Mingan Islands (northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, eastern Canada) in the summer and fall of 2001. Invertebrates were sampled in patches or beds of 4 species of macroalgae (Alaria esculenta, Agarum cribrosum, Desmarestia viridis and Ptilota serrata) as well as in adjacent urchin barrens. Multivariate analyses of the invertebrates on the algal fronds, those on the underlying substratum, and the 2 groups together demonstrated differences in invertebrate assemblages among all 5 habitats. A. esculenta sheltered the most distinct invertebrate community due to the domination of the substratum under this alga by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Differences among other canopy types were due to differences in invertebrate assemblages both on the algal fronds and on the substratum. A manipulative experiment involving the removal of the canopy of the 2 most abundant macroalgae, A. esculenta and A. cribrosum, was carried out to examine their effects on mussels. Recruitment of mussels onto ceramic tiles varied among treatments and was greatest in the A. esculenta zone with greater, but non-significant, recruitment under the canopy. The growth of mussels from early July to October was higher in the A. cribrosum zone than the A. esculenta zone. However, there was no effect of the algal canopy in either zone. Our study demonstrates that the local diversity and distribution of benthic invertebrates is intimately associated with macroalgae, and reinforces the need for detailed sampling and analyses for assessing distributional patterns.},

abstract = {Simultaneous abundance or shortage of mussels over vast areas may seriously affect fishery as well as shellfish-eating birds. We studied synchrony in annual recruit numbers and stock sizes (biomass) of mussels on the base of long-term observations in various parts of the Dutch (and German) Wadden Sea, including regular monitoring on Balgzand (a 50-km2 tidal flat area) and published or unpublished records for other parts of the Wadden Sea. Annual records for 37 years of mussel seed abundance in the eastern and western half of the Dutch Wadden Sea proved to be mutually well correlated and were also significantly correlated with annually assessed numerical densities of mussel recruits on Balgzand. The scarce long-term series available on mussel biomass pointed to significantly positive correlations between stock sizes on Balgzand and those in the northern German Wadden Sea, at about 300 km distance. The incidence of severe winters, which occurrence is synchronized over areas in the order of thousands of km, is identified as the dominant causative factor behind Wadden Sea-wide recruitment synchrony. Severe winters are known to reduce abundance of predators on tiny bivalve spat, and this process may overrule local processes causing abundance variation in bivalves. As such extreme winters are infrequent (usually only one or two per decade), sensible studies on the phenomenon of synchronization in abundance of Wadden Sea bivalves should be based on data series of sufficient length, covering decades.},

@article{Blanchet_2008,
abstract = {This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance. Correcting these problems will greatly improve the performance of this very useful method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem, we propose a two-step procedure. First, a global test using all explanatory variables is carried out. If, and only if, the global test is significant, one can proceed with forward selection. To prevent overestimation of the explained variance, the forward selection has to be carried out with two stopping criteria: (1) the usual alpha significance level and (2) the adjusted coefficient of multiple determination (R 2a) calculated using all explanatory variables. When forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, USA. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

@article{Blicher_2013,
abstract = {The blue mussel Mytilus edulis is widely distributed and acknowledged for its ecological importance in the intertidal zone in northern temperate areas. However, detailed studies of the structure and dynamics of intertidal M. edulis populations are lacking in its northern distribution area. This study provides baseline information on the population structure of M. edulis in the mid-intertidal zone of the sub-arctic Godth{\aa}bsfjord in West Greenland (64° N). Abundance was very patchy (average 18.6 ind. 0.049 m-2; range 0 to 312) and concentrated around crevices, boulders and macroalgae beds. Average biomass was 7.78 g wet mass 0.049 m-2. Young specimens <3 yr old (or <15 mm shell length) made up 82% of the population. Maximum age was estimated at 19 yr. The age structure suggested that the annual instantaneous mortality rate, Z, gradually decreased with age from 0.82 to 0.12. Growth functions obtained from size-at-age data showed significant differences between sampling sites in the Godth{\aa}bsfjord, overall covering much of the geographical variation found in the North Atlantic. The absence of invertebrate predators in the intertidal in this sub-Arctic habitat suggests that physical drivers are important for structuring the M. edulis community. Winter temperatures below -15°C combined with ice scouring are suggested to be the key drivers. Crevices, boulders and macroalgae beds are important refuges during detrimental extreme events but also provide variable growth conditions. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

@article{CLARKE_1993,
abstract = {Abstract In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi‐species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often‐quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self‐consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically‐relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example ‘sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C'. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non‐parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.

@article{Drinkwater_2011,
abstract = {The Norwegian Component of the Ecosystem Studies of Sub-Arctic Seas (NESSAS) was funded by the Research Council of Norway from 2005 to 2008. Its aim was to quantify the impact of climate variability on the structure and function of the marine ecosystem of the Barents Sea and adjacent waters in order to predict the ecosystem responses to possible future climate change and their possible economic impact. This paper reviews research highlights dealing with climate forcing and its influence. New insights were provided on the role of large-scale atmospheric forcing on the physical oceanography including the effect of Arctic and Atlantic cyclones on the variability of the ice extent in the Barents Sea and the non-linear response of the sub-polar gyre to North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) forcing. In addition, the NAO was also shown to influence the biology, for example shrimp recruitment in the Barents Sea and primary production in the Nordic Seas, with the strength and sign of the correlations being spatially dependent. The importance of longer term climate variability in the form of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (60-80. years period) was stressed, as it leads to significant changes in fish production, shifts in distribution and changes in spawning sites in the Barents Sea as well as other northern Atlantic ecosystems. Results from comparative studies between several US ecosystems and those of the Norwegian and Barents Seas are presented, including evidence of increased primary productivity in the Barents Sea in recent years and the poleward movement of zooplankton and fish. In addition recruitment patterns of major demersal and pelagic species in the Barents Sea generally show synchrony with those in the Gulf of Maine indicating a common external forcing. Possible ecosystem scenarios for the Barents Sea under anthropogenic-induced future climate change were developed including expectations of structural and functional changes due to distributional changes of many species. Of particular note is the likelihood of increases in the productivity of several fish species, including cod and herring, which potentially could result in higher fisheries yields. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim For decades, subfossil shells of the bivalve Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758 in Svalbard have been taken as evidence of higher surface temperatures during the early Holocene because the modern northern occurrence of this mollusc was, until recently, in the southern Barents Sea. Here, we elucidate and discuss the spatial and temporal Late Pleistocene and Holocene distribution of the species within the entire Barents Sea region. Location The Barents Sea region. Methods Radiocarbon dates of Mytilus shells from the Barents Sea region and information about the present distribution of the species were compiled, including two new radiocarbon dates from north-eastern Spitsbergen. The dataset was divided into time slices, each covering 1000years, and compared with Holocene temperature variations, ocean current systems and present-day temperature patterns. Results Maps show the Late Pleistocene and Holocene spatial and temporal distribution of Mytilus edulis in the Barents Sea region. M. edulis was already present in northern Norway about 14,000cal. yr bp. It appeared at western Spitsbergen about 11,000cal. yr bp, and slowly spread to the rest of the archipelago. The maximum distribution in the region was reached 10,000-7000cal. yr bp, coinciding with the Holocene climatic optimum. The species gradually disappeared in the late Holocene and became absent from the northern and eastern parts of the region 3000-1000cal. yr bp. Today, M. edulis lives in the southern part and has begun to recolonize the northern parts. Main conclusions The time slices illustrate strong connections between the ocean current regimes, the climate and the distribution of M. edulis. The species settled in the southern part of the Barents Sea region several thousand years before it spread to the northern part during the Holocene climatic optimum. It may even have been completely absent from the region for a short time during the late Holocene cold period. The Holocene distribution of Mytilus implies that the underlying pattern of coastal sea surface temperatures in the region was very stable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The Atlantic gateway to the Arctic Ocean is influenced by vigorous inflows of Atlantic Water. The high-latitude impacts of these inflows have strengthened owing to climate change, particularly since 2000, driving so-called ‘Atlantification' — a transition of Arctic waters to a state more closely resembling that of the Atlantic. In this Review, we discuss the physical and ecological manifestations of Atlantification in a hotspot region of climate change spanning the southern Barents Sea to the Eurasian Basin. Atlantification is driven by anomalous Atlantic Water inflows and is modulated by local processes, including: reduced atmospheric cooling, which amplifies warming in the southern Barents Sea; reduced freshwater input and stronger influence of ice import in the northern Barents Sea; and enhanced upper ocean mixing and air–ice–ocean coupling in the Eurasian Basin. Ecosystem responses to Atlantification encompass increased production, northward expansion of boreal species (borealization), an increased importance of the pelagic compartment populated by new species, an increasingly connected food web and a gradual reduction of the ice-associated ecosystem compartment. Considering the complex evidence supporting Atlantification, dedicated, multidisciplinary observations and advanced modelling experiments targeting large-scale changes in the system and specific mechanisms responsible for local and remote changes are urgently needed.},

abstract = {Direct and indirect effects of global warming are expected to be pronounced and fast in the Arctic, impacting terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. The Barents Sea is a high latitude shelf Sea and a boundary area between arctic and boreal faunas. These faunas are likely to respond differently to changes in climate. In addition, the Barents Sea is highly impacted by fisheries and other human activities. This strong human presence places great demands on scientific investigation and advisory capacity. In order to identify basic community structures against which future climate related or other human induced changes could be evaluated, we analyzed species composition and diversity of demersal fish in the Barents Sea. We found six main assemblages that were separated along depth and temperature gradients. There are indications that climate driven changes have already taken place, since boreal species were found in large parts of the Barents Sea shelf, including also the northern Arctic area. When modelling diversity as a function of depth and temperature, we found that two of the assemblages in the eastern Barents Sea showed lower diversity than expected from their depth and temperature. This is probably caused by low habitat complexity and the distance to the pool of boreal species in the western Barents Sea. In contrast coastal assemblages in south western Barents Sea and along Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Eastern Barents Sea can be described as diversity "hotspots"; the South-western area had high density of species, abundance and biomass, and here some species have their northern distribution limit, whereas the Novaya Zemlya area has unique fauna of Arctic, coastal demersal fish.

abstract = {Aim We tested whether the contraction of the equatorward boundary of an intertidal organism, the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, was due to high summer temperatures limiting mortality.Location The Atlantic coast of the United States.Methods Field transplant experiments were conducted at three locations along the US Atlantic coast. Survival and heat shock protein 70 expression were determined at biweekly intervals. Air and water temperature profiles were used to model current and historical patterns of mortality, and to determine rates of temperature change.Results High levels of mortality and expression of the inducible heat shock protein 70 were observed after multiple consecutive aerial exposures of 32 °C or greater. Since 1960, seasonal air and water temperatures have increased along the eastern US seaboard, and south of Lewes, DE (38.8° N) summer sea surface temperature increases have exceeded the upper lethal limits of this organism.Main conclusions Along the southern portion of its range, intertidal populations of M. edulis have experienced catastrophic mortality directly associated with summer high temperatures. Over the past 50 years, a geographic contraction of the southern, equatorward range edge of M. edulis has occurred, shifting the range edge approximately 350 km north of the previous limit at Cape Hatteras, NC (35.2° N). {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Mussel beds are common in many intertidal and subtidal habitats, including sub-Arctic and Arctic regions. Despite their ecological importance, little is known about the demographic processes governing the development of mussel beds and particularly about the synchronization of these processes at different spatial scales. The development of a relatively compact, narrow littoral mussel bed of Mytilus trossulus, extending several hundred m along the shore of Koni Peninsula (Tauyskaya Bay, northern Sea of Okhotsk), was studied for four years during the period 2014–2017. This model bed was located along an exposed coast with a seasonal sea ice cover. It was used to test the hypothesis that small-scale synchronization exists, i.e., the changes in demographic structure of the population that occur simultaneously within a single mussel bed follow a similar pattern. This hypothesis was rejected. The size structure of the mussel population at the same tidal level changed from being uniform (2014) to being varied in 2015–2017. The course of development of the mussel population was different at the opposite ends of the bed. The cause of these differences may be unequal levels of recruitment of juveniles in the form of a gradient from one end of the bed to the other over the length of the bed. The gradient was associated with transition from one type of shore dynamic processes to another (accumulation vs. abrasion). Small-scale desynchronization may represent one of the reasons explaining the heterogeneity of mussel populations. The possibility of desynchronization of demographic processes should be taken into consideration when studying the spatial organization and dynamics of mussel beds.},

We examine its genetic affinity to selected North Atlantic populations and the modes of spread that may be responsible for its recent re-colonisation. We record here its distribution on Svalbard archipelago along the north-western coastline and within Isfjorden collected over a seven years period. We record for the first time the intertidal occurrence that includes a presence close to a glacier front. Genetic composition of mussels Mytilus spp. from different Svalbard locations reveal similarities mainly with populations of M. edulis, M. trossulus and their hybrid from Western Europe, Faroe Island, Scotland and Norway. The re-introduction to Svalbard most probably involved shipping and natural or anthropogenic flotsam. It seems that a new transport vector - large plastic debris - plays a significant role in this process.},

abstract = {The blue mussels Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus occur sympatrically and are able to hybridize in populations on the eastern coast of Newfoundland, Canada, presenting an opportunity to study their aggregational behavior. Aggregation behavior may therefore provide insight into post-settlement interactions and pre-zygotic reproductive isolation between the species. Three treatments were designed using M. edulis and M. trossulus to investigate their intraspecific and interspecific spatial distribution patterns. With Ripley's K-function and Monte Carlo simulation analysis, we found that in the single-species treatment, M. edulis aggregated significantly but not M. trossulus. Based on results of two-way ANOVAs, both the number of aggregations and the moving distance were significantly affected by the treatments (single-species or mixed-species treatment) and times (24, 48, 72 and 96h). In further pairwise comparisons using Tukey's test, M. edulis aggregated differently with or without M. trossulus occupying the same tank, suggesting that the aggregational behavior of M. edulis could be driven by species-specific chemical cues. The result that M. edulis aggregates intraspecifically may increase the probability of intraspecific fertilization of the spawned gametes and thus function as a pre-zygotic reproductive isolation mechanism maintaining the blue mussel hybrid zone. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {The authors provide a detailed climatology and evaluation of recent climate change in the Kola Peninsula, Arctic Russia, a region influenced by both the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The analysis is based on 50 years of monthly surface air temperature (SAT), precipitation (PPN), and sea level pressure (SLP) data from 10 meteorological stations for 1966-2015. Regional mean annual SAT is $\sim$0°C: the moderating effect of the ocean is such that coastal (inland) stations have a positive (negative) value. Examined mean annual PPN totals rise from $\sim$430 mm in the northeast of the region to $\sim$600 mm in the west. Annual SAT in the Kola Peninsula has increased by 2.3° ± 1.0°C over the past 50 years. Seasonally, statistically significant warming has taken place in spring and fall, although the largest trend has occurred in winter. Although there has been no significant change in annual PPN, spring has become significantly wetter and fall drier. The former is associated with the only significant seasonal SLP trend (decrease). A positive winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index is generally associated with a warmer and wetter Kola Peninsula whereas a positive Siberian high (SH) index has the opposite impact. The relationship between both the NAO and SH and the SAT is broadly coherent across the region whereas their relationship with PPN varies markedly, although none of the relationships is temporally invariant. Reduced sea ice in the Barents and White Seas and associated circulation changes are likely to be the principal drivers behind the observed changes.},

abstract = {The Barents Sea is a transition zone between North Atlantic and Arctic waters, so its marine ecosystem is highly sensitive to climate dynamics. Understanding of marine biota response to climate changes is necessary to assess the environmental stability and the state of marketable biological resources. These processes are analyzed using a database from the Murmansk Marine Biological Institute which holds oceanographic and hydrobiological data sets collected for more than 100 years along the meridional Kola Transect in the Barents Sea. The data demonstrate high variability in thermal state of the upper layer of the Barents Sea, which is regulated by varying the inflow of Atlantic water and by regional climate. At irregular intervals, cold periods with extended seasonal ice cover are followed by warm periods. The most recent warm period started in the late 1980s and reached its maximum from 2001 to 2006. These cyclic changes in hydrologic regime across the twentieth century and first decade of the twenty-first century are reflected (with a specific lag of 1-5 years) by changes in species composition, as well as abundance and distribution of boreal and arctic groups of macrozoobenthos and fish fauna. For instance, cod and cod fisheries in the Barents Sea are closely linked to the marine climate. Furthermore, Kamchatka crab stock recruitment benefited from the warm climate of 1989 and 1990. In general, studies in this region have shown that climatic dynamics may be assessed using biological indices of abundance, biomass, and migration of marine organisms, including commercial species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Temperature is a major factor contributing to the biogeography of intertidal poikilo- therms. The population dynamics of intertidal invertebrates like mussels are strongly dependent on larval supply and larval mortality. Unlike adults, which are resistant to fluctuating environmental conditions, larvae are highly sensitive to the physicochemical conditions of the pelagic zone. The effects of rearing temperature on larval and post-larval performance of 2 coexisting mussels species, Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus, were examined in this study. In the first experiment, larvae of both species were reared separately at constant temperatures of 10, 17, and 24°C from D-larvae to the dissoconch stage. In the second experiment, pediveligers were reared under the same experimental conditions as the larvae for 2 wk. Survival, growth, and lipid composition (triacylglycerol [TAG] and sterol [ST] contents) were used to compare the performance of both species. The first experiment showed a species-specific thermal tolerance range, reflecting the biogeography of the species. M. trossulus larvae showed a preference for water at 10 and 17°C, corresponding to the more northerly distribution of this species, whereas M. edulis preferred temperatures of 17 and 24°C. Moreover, the TAG content in larvae of both species varied with temperature, supporting the hypothesis of a positive correlation between energy reserve content and the survival of mussel larvae. In contrast, the species-specific characteristics of thermal tolerance were not observed during post-larval development, suggesting that the selective effect of temperature on mussel species occurs during early ontogeny. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract = {To understand the mechanisms of invasions it is necessary to explore how thermal environments affect the distribution of both native and invasive species. We examined patterns of species distribution at several scales to determine how thermal selection affects the distribution of native (Mytilus trossulus) and invading (M. galloprovincialis) mussels inhabiting marine rocky intertidal and subtidal habitats. Previous work on these species has focused on the role of water temperature in setting distribution patterns, neglecting the role of aerial exposure at low tide. We therefore examined patterns of abundance in shaded and sun-exposed intertidal habitats and in intertidal versus subtidal habitats at sites within the San Francisco Bay over 3 yr. At half (2/4) of the sites the abundance of the native mussel was significantly higher in shaded intertidal habitats compared to warmer, sun-exposed intertidal habitats, where the invasive mussels were more abundant. Additionally, when comparisons were made between paired subtidal and intertidal sites, native mussel abundance was higher in subtidal habitats. In general, however, there was an unexplained and steady decrease in M. trossulus abundance at all sites. Field transplant experiments showed that the native mussel had lower survivorship than the invading species in all habitats examined (subtidal, shaded, and sun-exposed intertidal). Overall survivorship was lowest for both species in the sun-exposed intertidal treatments. This study shows that physiological stress associated with aerial exposure is likely to contribute to the local and geographic distribution of these mussel species. Moreover, our results suggest that processes that operate over larger geographic scales may be experimentally detectable over much smaller scales. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract = {Extreme events such as heat waves have increased in frequency and duration over the last decades. Under future climate scenarios, these discrete climatic events are expected to become even more recurrent and severe. Heat waves are particularly important on rocky intertidal shores, one of the most thermally variable and stressful habitats on the planet. Intertidal mussels, such as the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, are ecosystem engineers of global ecological and economic importance, that occasionally suffer mass mortalities. This study investigates the potential causes and consequences of a mass mortality event of M. edulis that occurred along the French coast of the eastern English Channel in summer 2018. We used an integrative, climatological and ecophysiological methodology based on three complementary approaches. We first showed that the observed mass mortality (representing 49 to 59% of the annual commercial value of local recreational and professional fisheries combined) occurred under relatively moderate heat wave conditions. This result indicates that M. edulis body temperature is controlled by non-climatic heat sources instead of climatic heat sources, as previously reported for intertidal gastropods. Using biomimetic loggers (i.e. ‘robomussels'), we identified four periods of 5 to 6 consecutive days when M. edulis body temperatures consistently reached more than 30 °C, and occasionally more than 35 °C and even more than 40 °C. We subsequently reproduced these body temperature patterns in the laboratory to infer M. edulis thermal tolerance under conditions of repeated heat stress. We found that thermal tolerance consistently decreased with the number of successive daily exposures.

abstract = {Macroalgal and urchin barren communities are alternately stable and persist in the Aleutians due to sea otter presence and absence. In the early 1990s a rapid otter population decline released urchins from predation and caused a shift to the urchin-dominated state. Despite increases in urchin abundance, otter numbers continued to decline. Although debated, prey quality changes have been implicated in current otter population status. This study examined otter prey abundance, size, biomass, and potential energy density in remnant kelp forest and urchin-dominated communities to determine if alternate stable states affect prey quality. Findings suggest that although urchin barrens provide more abundant urchin prey, individual urchins are smaller and provide lower biomass and potential energy density compared to kelp forests. Shifts to urchin barrens do affect prey quality but changes are likely compensated by increased prey densities and are insufficient in explaining current otter population status in the Aleutians.},

@article{ter_Braak_1995,
abstract = {Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) is a multivariate method to elucidate the relationships between biological assemblages of species and their environment. The method is designed to extract synthetic environmental gradients from ecological data-sets. The gradients are the basis for succinctly describing and visualizing the differential habitat preferences (niches) of taxa via an ordination diagram. Linear multivariate methods for relating two set of variables, such as two-block Partial Least Squares (PLS2), canonical correlation analysis and redundancy analysis, are less suited for this purpose because habitat preferences are often unimodal functions of habitat variables. After pointing out the key assumptions underlying CCA, the paper focuses on the interpretation of CCA ordination diagrams. Subsequently, some advanced uses, such as ranking environmental variables in importance and the statistical testing of effects are illustrated on a typical macroinvertebrate data-set. The paper closes with comparisons with correspondence analysis, discriminant analysis, PLS2 and co-inertia analysis. In an appendix a new method, named CCA-PLS, is proposed that combines the strong features of CCA and PLS2. {\textcopyright} 1995 Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag.},

abstract = {Advancing our understanding of how environmental variability affects the distribution of organisms is crucial for ecology and conservation. The exploration of changes in demographic patterns close to species distribution margins is important as populations here may provide a window into future population changes also elsewhere. However, the knowledge of factors causing recruitment variation is still inadequate in many systems and this deficiency is particularly evident close to species' distribution borders. We studied the spatiotemporal variability in recruit-adult dynamics in a blue mussel, Mytilus trossulus, population to get insights into how environmental variables drive variation in recruitment and how this variability affects adult population growth. Thirty sites along a wave exposure gradient were monitored during four consecutive years. From each site, mussels were collected both from artificial recruitment units and from natural mussel beds. Our results showed high year-to-year variation in recruitment strength with high spatial variation. Mussel recruitment to artificial units and later recruitment to the benthos correlated highly. Juvenile abundances 1 year later paralleled prior recruitment strengths and caused synchronous but time-lagged changes in adult cohorts. Seawater salinity was the strongest predictor for recruitment variation, whereas sea temperature and wave exposure had low predictive power for this early life stage. For juveniles and for adults in the benthos, wave exposure explained the variation best, whereas temperature and especially salinity explained less. The results indicate that (a) the studied blue mussel population is strongly driven by variation in recruitment strength that (b) drives the size of the later cohorts, and the population is possibly even (c) recruitment limited in some years. Our study predicts a challenging future for this range population, resulting from a higher frequency of recruitment failure caused by a deteriorating sea climate. Knowledge about factors underlying variation in recruitment is thus essential for forecasting the future of this range population and for conserving its future state.},

abstract = {{\"{i}}¿½ 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland. Dense blue mussel assemblages are unstable, their structure changing from year to year. Three types of models can be used to describe this instability: (1) “exogenous” model based on regional temperature fluctuations, (2) “endogenous” deterministic model associated with negative impact of adult mussels on juveniles and (3) “density-linked stochasticity” model based on positive feedbacks resulting in overcrowding and destabilizing the settlement. We compared predictions deduced from these models with a time series based on the results of long-term (18{\"{i}}¿½years) monitoring of abundance and demographic structure of three mussel beds at the White Sea. Most of our findings agreed well with the predictions deduced from the endogenous model. In particular, (1) long-term changes in mussel abundance and demographic structure were strictly cyclic, with non-matching periods (5–9{\"{i}}¿½years) at different sites; (2) stages with the dominance of old mussels alternated with those where juveniles dominated and (3) some signals of delayed density dependence were revealed. However, the time series also contained elements of long-term trends, which may testify to the involvement of some exogenous factors (probably long-term climate changes).},
