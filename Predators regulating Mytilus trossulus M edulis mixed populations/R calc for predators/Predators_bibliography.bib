@article{Beaumont2008,
abstract = {Three species of the mussel, Mytilus, occur in the North Atlantic region, M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus, and hybrid zones are present where their distributions overlap. M. edulis is a native species in the UK. M. galloprovincialis originated in the Mediterranean and its distribution extends northwards along the Atlantic seaboard to Scotland. Baltic Sea mussels have a M. trossulus ancestry but are highly introgressed by M. edulis. In recent decades, farming of mussels on long-line rope culture systems has been introduced into Scotland. On farms in Loch Etive, a form of mussel with a fragile shell and a different shape to either M. edulis or M. galloprovincialis has been increasing in frequency over recent years. Samples of fragile shelled, normal strong shelled and intermediate mussel types were sampled from two farms in 2006 and compared with samples of M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus from other sources where their species identity is well established. Abundance relative to depth, shell strength, condition index and shell morphology were analysed together with 5 allozyme loci and one nuclear DNA genetic marker (Me 15/16). The fragile shelled mussels, and many of those classed as intermediate, were identified as a mixture of M. trossulus and M. trossulus x M. edulis hybrids. This identification was strongly supported by both morphological and genetic data and is the first record of the presence of M. trossulus in UK waters. M. trossulus in Loch Etive are most likely to be a post-glacial relict population restricted to the low salinity area of the Loch that has recently increased in abundance due to commercial mussel growing activity. In addition, individual mussels of all three species and their hybrids were detected amongst Loch Etive mussels. This is the first genetic demonstration of all three species and their hybrids occurring together in one location in the Atlantic region and provides a unique opportunity to study the processes of speciation, divergence, and introgression in the genus Mytilus. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Khaitov2018,
abstract = {Sea stars {\it Asterias rubens} are important natural enemies of the blue mussel Mytilus in the North Atlantic. We asked whether these predators distinguish between the cryptic species M. edulis and M. trossulus that occur sympatrically in the White Sea. In mixed experimental stocks, the odds of being eaten by sea stars were about four times greater for M. trossulus. We also showed that A. rubens preferred smaller mussels to larger ones, irrespective of their species affinity. Our findings support earlier indirect observations showing that sea stars recognize M. trossulus as a more preferable prey than M. edulis. Dramatic differences in the vulnerability to sea star predation may explain the segregation of habitats between the two mussel species in contact zones; M. trossulus usually tends to occupy habitats where the sea star predators are scarce.},

abstract = {From data on allozyme, nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA markers, we show that the originally North Pacific/Northwest Atlantic mussel {\it Mytilus trossulus} is widespread on North European coasts, earliM. trossuluser thought to be inhabited only by {\it Mytilus edulis}. Several local occurrences of, interspersed with a dominant M. edulis, were recorded on the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea coasts of Norway and the Barents and White Sea coasts of Kola Peninsula in Russia. The proportion of M. trossulus genetic background observed at any one site varied from 0 to 95%. These new occurrences are not related to the previously known, introgressed M. trossulus population that occupies the Baltic Sea. The new northern occurrences retain both the F and M M. trossulus mitochondria, which have been lost from the Baltic stock. While hybridization takes place wherever M. trossulus and M. edulis meet, the extent of hybrization varies between the different contact areas. Hybrids are rare, and the hybrid zones are bimodal in the northern areas; more interbreeding has taken place further south in Norway, but even there genotypic disequilibria are higher than those in the steep transition zone between the Baltic mussel and M. edulis: there is no evidence of a collapse toward a hybrid swarm unlike in the Baltic. The Barents and White Sea M. trossulus are genetically slightly closer to the NW Atlantic than NE Pacific populations, while the Baltic mussel has unique features distinguishing it from the others. We postulate that the presence of M. trossulus in Northern Europe is a result of repeated independent inter- or transoceanic cryptic invasions of various ages, up to recent times. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

@article{Stuckas2017,
abstract = {While secondary contact between {\it Mytilus edulis} and {\it Mytilus trossulus} in North America results in mosaic hybrid zone formation, both species form a hybrid swarm in the Baltic. Despite pervasive gene flow, Baltic Mytilus species maintain substantial genetic and phenotypic differentiation. Exploring mechanisms underlying the contrasting genetic composition in Baltic Mytilus species will allow insights into processes such as speciation or adaptation to extremely low salinity. Previous studies in the Baltic indicated that only weak interspecific reproductive barriers exist and discussed the putative role of adaptation to environmental conditions. Using a combination of hydrodynamic modelling and multilocus genotyping, we investigate how oceanographic conditions influence passive larval dispersal and hybrid swarm formation in the Baltic. By combining our analyses with previous knowledge, we show a genetic transition of Baltic Mytilus species along longitude 12°-13°E, that is a virtual line between Malm{\"{o}} (Sweden) and Stralsund (Germany). Although larval transport only occurs over short distances (10–30 km), limited larval dispersal could not explain the position of this genetic transition zone. Instead, the genetic transition zone is located at the area of maximum salinity change (15–10 psu). Thus, we argue that selection results in weak reproductive barriers and local adaptation. This scenario could maintain genetic and phenotypic differences between Baltic Mytilus species despite pervasive introgressive hybridization.},

@article{Kamermans2009,
abstract = {In The Netherlands, several pilot projects are carried out on the use of spat collectors as an additional supply of seed for bottom culture of mussels ({\it Mytilus edulis}). The method proves to be successful in yielding substantial amounts of seed. One of the conditions for successful application of collector seed on bottom plots is a good yield of the seed on bottom plots. Mussel seed of different origin (from wild littoral and sublittoral beds or from collectors) was offered to predators (crabs Carcinus maenas and starfish {\it Asterias rubens}) and seed survival was monitored. In addition, the effect of density and size of collector seed on predation was studied. Circular cages containing predators and seed were placed in a basin with running seawater, or suspended from a jetty in a harbour. Two size classes of predators and three size classes of seed were used. Survival was monitored. Consumption of mussel seed by starfish was much lower than by crabs. Maximum observed consumption rates were 23 seed/day/crab and 1 seed/day/starfish. Consumption rates increased significantly with decreasing seed size. Seed larger than 20 mm were consumed at a significantly lower rate. Seed density did not affect survival. Collector seed was not consumed at higher rates than wild littoral or sublittoral seed. In conclusion, collector seed can be a promising additional source of seed for bottom culture of mussels in The Netherlands. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The largest intertidal swarm occupied about 2 {\textperiodcentered} 5 ha (1600 × 15 m) at its peak, and contained at least 2 {\textperiodcentered} 4 × 106starfish of 6 cm mean arm radius. Feeding concentrations within swarms commonly attained 300 to 400 starfish per m2, representing a wet weight biomass of around 12 to 16 kg/m2. In 3 months (June-August), the largest swarm systematically cleared mussels from 50 ha, which otherwise should have held at least 3500 tonnes of 20 mm seed by September. The frontal boundary of large swarms sometimes advanced 150 to 200 m per month, or 5 to 7 m daily. Swarms retreated rapidly to deeper water in early autumn and apparently overwintered outside the bay. Movements and navigation of swarms towards mussel beds are discussed in relation to the olfactory sense and positive rheotaxis demonstrated recently in A. rubens. {\textcopyright} 1982 Conseil International pour l'Exploration de la Mer.},

abstract = {The blue mussels {\it Mytilus edulis} and {\it Mytilus trossulus} occur sympatrically and are able to hybridize in populations on the eastern coast of Newfoundland, Canada, presenting an opportunity to study their aggregational behavior. Aggregation behavior may therefore provide insight into post-settlement interactions and pre-zygotic reproductive isolation between the species. Three treatments were designed using M. edulis and M. trossulus to investigate their intraspecific and interspecific spatial distribution patterns. With Ripley's K-function and Monte Carlo simulation analysis, we found that in the single-species treatment, M. edulis aggregated significantly but not M. trossulus. Based on results of two-way ANOVAs, both the number of aggregations and the moving distance were significantly affected by the treatments (single-species or mixed-species treatment) and times (24, 48, 72 and 96h). In further pairwise comparisons using Tukey's test, M. edulis aggregated differently with or without M. trossulus occupying the same tank, suggesting that the aggregational behavior of M. edulis could be driven by species-specific chemical cues. The result that M. edulis aggregates intraspecifically may increase the probability of intraspecific fertilization of the spawned gametes and thus function as a pre-zygotic reproductive isolation mechanism maintaining the blue mussel hybrid zone. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

@article{Okamura1986,
abstract = {The mussel {\it Mytilus edulis} typically occurs in aggregations and several consequences of living in groups were studied. Isolated individuals and individuals associated in relatively small groups (6-9 mussles/group) grew more and therefore had greater reproductive output than mussels associated with relatively large groups of 21-28 individuals. Mussels located in the centers of groups exhibited reduced growth and thus lower reproduction relative to mussels located on the edges of groups whose growth and reproduction was similar to that of isolated individuals. Sampling from natural populations indicated that most mussels grow within the matrix of very large groups and hence will experience reduced growth and reproduction. Patterns of growth exhibited by mussels in association with living and model mussels showed that the adverse effects on growth exhibited by mussels in relatively large groups are not a function of the mere physical relief of a mussel clump, but are caused by some property of living neighbors. Laboratory experiments on mussel predation by the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes indicated that crabs prey disproportionately on mussels growing on the edges of groups. The consequences of group living in mobile and nonmobile organisms are considered, and it is suggested that a greater number of negative effects will arise in groups as mobility decreases. In addition, the noted ecological similarity between groups of sessile organisms and spreading clones and its evolutionary implications are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Zimmer2017,
abstract = {Keystone species structure ecological communities and are major determinants of biodiversity. A synthesis of research on keystone species is nonetheless missing a critical component – the sensory mechanisms for behavioral interactions that determine population- and community-wide attributes. Here, we establish the chemosensory basis for keystone predation by sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus) on mussels. This consumer-resource interaction is prototypic of top-down driven trophic cascades. Each mussel species (Mytilus californianus and M. galloprovincialis) secretes a glycoprotein orthologue (29.6 and 28.1 kDa, respectively) that acts, singularly, to evoke the sea star predatory response. The orthologues (named “KEYSTONEin”) are localized in the epidermis, extrapallial fluid, and organic shell coating (periostracum) of live, intact mussels. Thus, KEYSTONEin contacts chemosensory receptors on tube feet as sea stars crawl over rocky surfaces in search of prey. The complete nucleotide sequences reveal that KEYSTONEin shares 87% (M. californianus) or 98% (M. galloprovincialis) homology with a calcium-binding protein in the shell matrix of a closely related congener, M. edulis. All three molecules cluster tightly within the Complement Component 1 Domain Containing (C1qDC) protein family; each exhibits a large globular domain, low complexity region(s), coiled coil, and at least four of five histidine-aspartic acid tandem motifs. Collective results support the hypothesis that KEYSTONEin evolved ancestrally in immunological, and later, in biomineralization roles. More recently, the substance has become exploited by sea stars as a contact cue for prey recognition. As the first identified compound to evoke keystone predation, KEYSTONEin provides valuable sensory information, promotes biodiversity, and shapes community structure and function. Without this molecule, there would be no predation by sea stars on mussels.},

abstract = {Foundation species provide critical resources to ecological community members and are major determinants of biodiversity. One such species, the California mussel Mytilus californianus, is a superior competitor and dominates space on rocky, wave-swept shores (northeast Pacific Ocean). Live mussels secrete a 29.6 kDa glycoprotein (named 'KEYSTONEin'), with expression localized in epidermis, extrapallial fluid, and periostracum (organic shell coating). Hence, KEY-STONEin is available for contact recognition as predators crawl on rocky surfaces. Purple sea stars Pisaster ochraceus, whelks (Nucella emarginata and Acanthinucella spirata), and lined-shore crabs Pachygrapsus crassipes are common intertidal carnivores. Spanning 3 phyla and differing substantially in sensory mechanisms and hunting techniques, all are major mussel consumers. Here, we constructed faux prey to mimic both physical and chemical properties of mussels. Purified KEYSTONEin was presented at a typical mussel concentration. All 4 predatory species attacked, and ate, KEYSTONEin-infused faux prey as opposed to the organic enrichment or seawater controls. Sea stars, whelks (both species), and crabs also did not distinguish between KEY-STONEin-laced mimics and their live, intact counterparts. Mechanisms of chemical recognition thus have converged across phylogenetically diverse taxa to promote the exploitation of a valuable, shared, prey resource. By providing critical sensory information, KEYSTONEin drives mussel predation and initiates trophic cascades that shape community structure and function. KEY-STONEin is necessary and sufficient as a predatory cue of considerable ecological consequence.},

@article{Penney2008,
abstract = {Meat yield, expressed as the ratio of somatic tissue weight (flesh or meat weight) to total weight, is extensively used in the Atlantic Canadian mussel culture industry as a measure of product quality and market suitability at harvest. Atlantic Canadian mussel populations typically exhibit high genotypic variability with stocks at most sites consisting of mixtures of {\it Mytilus edulis}, M. trossulus, and their hybrids in widely varying proportions. In this paper, we examine relationships among genotypic variability, shell and somatic tissue weight, and their effect on measurement of meat yield. We further compare these relationships in populations grown from indigenous seed collection with those derived from transferred seedstock, and across different year classes within sites. Within 10 of 13 samples, M. edulis were greater than M. trossulus in shell length. Within all samples, weights of somatic tissue (flesh weight) and shell varied significantly with shell length. M. edulis typically had greater flesh and shell weights than M. trossulus. Hybrids tended to have intermediate values. Similar genotype-dependent relationships between shell weight and shell length occurred in all year classes taken from the same site. However, flesh weight relationships with shell length were inconsistent among year classes. Within-sample genotype-dependent relationships between flesh weight and shell length evident in indigenously-reared populations did not always persist in transferred populations. Meat yield was not significantly related to shell length. Meat yield was significantly greater in M. trossulus than in M. edulis in 12 of the 13 samples. Similar within-sample relationships between meat yield and genotype were evident among year classes and between indigenously-reared and transferred populations with M. trossulus having greater meat yields than M. edulis. Averaged over all samples, mean meat yield in M. trossulus was 7.4% greater than in M. edulis. Possible industry implications of these genotype-dependent differences are discussed.},

@article{Dickey2021,
abstract = {Predicting the myriad effects of climate change on ecological communities is a major challenge for scientists, and to date relatively few studies have focused on the effects of sea freshening on species interactions. In particular, changes in keystone species predatory effects could be pervasive. Here, we assess the consequences of decreasing salinity on the ecological impact exerted by a keystone predatory sea star, {\it Asterias rubens}. We quantified sea star functional responses (FRs; per capita predation as a function of prey density) under decreasing salinity treatments aligned with climate change projections (18ppt, 15ppt, 12ppt). Furthermore, we combined FRs with larval recruitment estimates, i.e. ecological “Impact Potential”, to act as an ecological indicator of predator population-level responses under this environmental change. Attack and maximum feeding rates of sea stars were reduced by decreasing salinities, with no instances of predation found at 12ppt. Given that decreasing salinities also reduced larval sea star recruitment, the overall Impact Potential of this keystone predator species was lessened by decreased salinity. Sea freshening projections by the end of this century could thus drive significant decreases in the effects of this keystone predator, with serious implications for the structuring and functioning of ecological communities.},

We hypothesized that sea stars do not forage on blue mussels according to the classical optimal foraging theory but are actively avoiding damage that may be caused by e.g. capture of foraging on too-strong mussel shells, hence the sea stars will have a stronger preference for mussels that are smaller than the most profitable ones. Here we present experimental evidence of the sea star {\it Asterias rubens} as a predator that indeed chooses much smaller blue mussels {\it Mytilus edulis} to forage on than the most profitable ones. Hence this study does not support the optimal foraging theory. There may be other constraints involved in foraging than just optimizing energy intake, for example predators may also be concerned with preventing potential loss or damage of their foraging instruments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Khaitov2021,
abstract = {Cryptic and hybridizing species may lack diagnostic taxonomic characters leaving researchers with semi-diagnostic ones. Identification based on such characters is probabilistic, the probability of correct identification depending on the species composition in a mixed population. Here we test the possibilities of applying a semi-diagnostic conchological character for distinguishing two cryptic species of blue mussels, {\it Mytilus edulis} and M. trossulus. These ecologically, stratigraphically and economically important molluscs co-occur and hybridize in many areas of the North Atlantic and the neighboring Arctic. Any cues for distinguishing them in sympatry without genotyping would save much research effort. Recently these species have been shown to statistically differ in the White Sea, where a simple character of the shell was used to distinguish two mussel morphotypes. In this paper, we analyzed the associations between morphotypes and species-specific genotypes based on an abundant material from the waters of the Kola Peninsula (White Sea, Barents Sea) and a more limited material from Norway, the Baltic Sea, Scotland and the Gulf of Maine. The performance of the “morphotype test” for species identification was formally evaluated using approaches from evidence-based medicine. Interspecific differences in the morphotype frequencies were ubiquitous and unidirectional, but their scale varied geographically (from 75% in the White Sea to 15% in the Baltic Sea). In addition, salinity-related variation of this character within M. edulis was revealed in the Arctic Barents Sea. For every studied region, we established relationships between the proportions of the morphotypes in the populations as well as between the proportions of the morphotypes in samples and the probabilities of mussels of different morphotypes being M. trossulus and M. edulis. We provide recommendations for the application of the morphotype test to mussels from unstudied contact zones and note that they may apply equally well to other taxa identified by semi-diagnostic traits.},

@article{Lowen2013,
abstract = {This is the first study to compare defenses to predation in closely related species of Mytilus and draws attention to the role of predation in determining their distribution, abundance and co-existence. We experimentally determined whether 2 blue mussel species, {\it Mytilus edulis} and M. trossulus, that co-exist within a hybrid zone in Newfoundland, Canada, differ in their predator-induced responses. Both species recognized cues from predators, although the magnitude of the responses to these cues varied with the predator ({\it Asterias rubens} or Cancer irroratus) and the traits measured (growth, attachment strength, shell thickness and adductor muscle mass) after 122 d of exposure. Both mussel species showed decreased growth following exposure to sea stars. Both predator species induced an increase in attachment strength in both mussel species (M. edulis > M. trossulus). M. edulis displayed plasticity in partitioning resources among defensive traits in the presence of sea stars (growth in adductor muscle) or crabs (increased shell thickness). These responses were not observed in M. trossulus, which is therefore likely more susceptible to these predators than is M. edulis. The preference of sea stars for M. trossulus supports this conclusion. Differences in predator-inducible defenses increase the likelihood of M. edulis succeeding M. trossulus in mussel aggregations, which in turn explains the often abrupt increase in the proportion of M. edulis among larger mussels. Such predator-induced defenses, and the resultant predator-prey interactions, affect the temporal and spatial distributions of mussel species and their potential to coexist and hybridize. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Two blue mussel lineages of Pliocene origin, {\it Mytilus edulis} (ME) and M. trossulus (MT), cooccur and hybridize in several regions on the shores of the North Atlantic. The two species were distinguished from each other by molecular methods in the 1980s, and a large amount of comparative data on them has been accumulated since that time. However, while ME and MT are now routinely distinguished by various genetic markers, they tend to be overlooked in ecological studies since morphological characters for taxonomic identification have been lacking, and no consistent habitat differences between lineages have been reported. Surveying a recently discovered area of ME and MT co-occurrence in the White Sea and employing a set of allozyme markers for identification, we address the issue whether ME and MT are true biological species with distinct ecological characteristics or just virtual genetic entities with no matching morphological and ecological identities. We find that: (1) in the White Sea, the occurrence of MT is largely concentrated in harbors, in line with observations from other subarctic regions of Europe; (2) mixed populations of ME and MT are always dominated by purebred individuals, animals classified as hybrids constituting only ca. 18%; (3) in terms of shell morphology, 80% of MT bear a distinct uninterrupted dark prismatic strip under the ligament while 97% of ME lack this character; (4) at sites of sympatry MT is more common on algal substrates while ME mostly lives directly on the bottom. This segregation by the substrate may contribute to maintaining reproductive isolation and decreasing competition between taxa. We conclude that while ME and MT are not fully reproductively isolated, they do represent clearly distinguishable biological, ecological and morphological entities in the White Sea. It remains to be documented whether the observed morphological and ecological differences are of a local character, or whether they have simply been overlooked in other contact zones.},

abstract = {We determined the distribution of two cryptic mussel species ({\it Mytilus edulis} and {\it M. trossulus}) along full gradients of wave exposure in northwest Atlantic rocky intertidal habitats. Research was conducted in Nova Scotia (Canada) and Maine (United States) and species were determined using genetic analyses. In very sheltered habitats, only M. edulis occurred. In sheltered, exposed, and very exposed habitats, both species co-existed, M. edulis predominating in Maine and M. trossulus in Nova Scotia. Hybrids were absent or rare. The distribution of mussels regardless of species (Mytilus spp.) was remarkably consistent across levels of wave exposure in both regions. In very sheltered habitats, organisms were large (4-5 cm long, on average) and old (7-8 years, on average) and occurred in low densities. In sheltered, exposed, and very exposed habitats, organisms were small (< 1 cm, on average) and young (1-2 years, on average); density was low in sheltered and very exposed habitats, but high in exposed habitats. Abundance data for predatory snails (dogwhelks, Nucella lapillus) and canopy-forming algae (Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus spp.) suggest that predation and facilitation may explain some of the observed changes in mussel population traits along the wave exposure gradients. Our results could be useful as baseline information to predict the effects of the progressive increase in wave action caused by climate change on intertidal mussel populations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

The study was performed in North and Baltic Sea characterized by strong gradients of environmental factors and almost continuous distributions of Mytilus mussel populations. Assessment of the species identity was performed using four nuclear DNA markers, and previously published single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. A general pattern of cline variation was observed with increasing {\it Mytilus trossulus} share towards the eastern Baltic Sea. Average allele share rose to 61% in H{\"{o}}ga Kusten, Gulf of Bothnia. All Baltic Sea samples revealed a strong introgression of {\it Mytilus edulis} and a limited introgression of M. trossulus through the Danish Straits. The studied environmental variables described 67 and 68% of the variability in the allele frequencies of M. edulis and M. trossulus. Salinity defined over 50% of the variability in the gene frequencies of the studied Mytilus spp. populations. Changes along this environmental gradient were not gradual but instead a significant shift from gene dominance was found at a salinity of 12 PSU. Water temperature and the trophic status of the sea area had only moderate association with the gene frequencies. The obtained results showed that the novel machine learning technique can be successfully used for finding correlations between genetic differentiation of populations and environmental variables and for defining the functional form of these linkages.},

abstract = {Investigating the history of natural selection among closely related species can elucidate how genomes diverge in response to disparate environmental pressures. Molecular evolutionary approaches can be integrated with knowledge of gene functions to examine how evolutionary divergence may affect ecologically relevant traits such as temperature tolerance and species distribution limits. Here, we integrate transcriptome-wide analyses of molecular evolution with knowledge from physiological studies to develop hypotheses regarding the functional classes of genes under positive selection in one of the world's most widespread invasive species, the warm-tolerant marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Based on existing physiological information, we test the hypothesis that genomic functions previously linked to divergent temperature adaptation at the whole-organism level show accelerated molecular divergence between warm-adapted M. galloprovincialis and cold-adapted congeners. Combined results from codon model tests and analyses of polymorphism and divergence reveal that divergent selection has affected genomic functions previously associated with species-specific expression responses to heat stress, namely oxidative stress defence and cytoskeletal stabilization. Examining specific loci implicated in thermal tolerance among Mytilus species (based on interspecific biochemical or expression patterns), we find close functional similarities between known thermotolerance candidate genes under positive selection and positively selected loci under predicted genomic functions (those associated with divergent expression responses). Taken together, our findings suggest a contribution of temperature-dependent selection in the molecular divergence between warm- and cold-adapted Mytilus species that is largely consistent with results from physiological studies. More broadly, this study provides an example of how independent experimental evidence from ecophysiological investigations can inform evolutionary hypotheses about molecular adaptation in closely related nonmodel species.},
