abstract = {Working in the context of the linear model y = X$\beta$ + $\epsilon$, we generalize the concept of variance inflation as a measure of collinearity to a subset of parameters in $\beta$ (denoted by $\beta$1, with the associated columns of X given by X1). The essential idea underlying this generalization is to examine the impact on the precision of estimation—in particular, the size of an ellipsoidal joint confidence region for $\beta$1—of less-than-optimal selection of other columns of the design matrix (X2), treating still other columns (X0) as unalterable, even hypothetically. In typical applications, X1contains a set of dummy regressors coding categories of a qualitative variable or a set of polynomial regressors in a quantitative variable; X2contains all other regressors in the model, save the constant, which is in X0. If $\sigma$2V denotes the realized variance of (Equation presented), and $\sigma$2U is the variance associated with an optimal selection of X2, then the corresponding scaled dispersion ellipsoids to be compared are ℰv= (x: x′V–1x ≤ 1) and ℰU= (x: x′U–1x ≤ 1), where ℰUis contained in ℰv. The two ellipsoids can be compared by considering the radii of ℰvrelative to ℰU, obtained through the spectral decomposition of V relative to U. We proceed to explore the geometry of generalized variance inflation, to show the relationship of these measures to correlation-matrix determinants and canonical correlations, to consider X matrices structured by relations of marginality among regressor subspaces, to develop the relationship of generalized variance inflation to hypothesis tests in the multivariate normal linear model, and to present several examples. {\textcopyright} 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The genotype distribution and allele frequencies varied significantly among samples from the different locations. The variations were most significant between localities with full strength seawater and brackish water, and this difference was so large that it indicated the presence of two populations, possibly representing two species. The brackish water mussels may represent the species Mytilus trossulus, while the species Mytilus edulis may be distributed on the outer shores where salinity is normally around 30‰. Differential survival, as a result of specific adaptation to different salinities, may be the mechanism that maintains the populations (or species) and prevents gene flow between them. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag and AWI 2004.},

abstract = {Semi-sessile Mytilus mussels are used as indicators of climate changes, but their geographic distribution is not sufficiently known in the Arctic. The aim of this study was to investigate the taxonomic status and genetic differentiation of Mytilus populations in a Northwest Greenlandic fjord at Maarmorilik, impacted by contaminations from a former mine. In this study, mussels were collected at three sites differing in exposure to environmental factors. A total of 54 polymorphic SNPs found in the Mytilus EST and DNA sequences analyzed were successfully applied to 256 individuals. The results provided the first evidence for the existence of M. trossulus in Greenland. The mussel from M.trossulus and M. edulis taxa are shown to coexist and hybridize in the fjord. The three studied sites were found to differ significantly in the distribution of taxa with a higher prevalence of M. trossulus in the inner fjord. The identified M. edulis × M. trossulus hybrids mostly had a hybrid index score of about 0.5, indicating a similar number of alleles characteristic for M. trossulus and M. edulis. There was a low number of backcrosses between ‘pure' taxa and hybrids. This newly discovered hybrid zone between the two taxa is unique in comparison with the Canadian populations. As Mytilus mussels in Greenland hitherto have been regarded as the one taxon M. edulis, the results have importance for biogeography and future monitoring and environmental studies.},

abstract = {The effect of salinity (5 to 25 ppt) on Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus that co-exist in Atlantic Canada was examined in 2 laboratory experiments. The first experiment tested the effect of salinity on survival and duration of development from fertilization to settlement in the 2 species. Hyposalinity reduced survivorship and percent metamorphosis, and lengthened duration of development. At 5 and 10 ppt, all early stages of both species died. At 25 ppt, >90% of individuals of both species survived through the oocyte to swimming embryo and swimming embryo to D-veliger stages, but only ca. 40% survived through the D-veliger to eyed-veliger stage, and 30 to 42% of eyed-veligers successfully metamorphosed. At 15 ppt, the 2 species significantly differed in survival rate, duration of development, and metamorphosis. M. edulis did not develop through any of the 3 stages from oocyte to eyed-veliger. No M. edulis eyed-veligers metamorphosed. In contrast, in M. trossulus, 26% of oocytes and 15% of swimming embryos developed into swimming embryos and D-veligers, respectively, and 13% of eyed-veligers metamorphosed into plantigrades. At 20 ppt, some M. edulis developed through each of the 4 stages, but the development time was longer and there was a lower percentage than for the corresponding stage of M. trossulus. The second experiment examined the effect of salinity on survival of juveniles and adults. The 2 species responded to hyposaline stress similarly. Survival ranged from 0 at 5 ppt to 100% at 20 to 25 ppt. At 10 ppt, reproductive status affected mortality, with <5% mortality in juveniles and post-spawning individuals, but 60 to 67% mortality in reproductive mussels. A similar situation occurred at 15 ppt except there was lower mortality for reproductive individuals. Thus, we found that only in the early ontogenetic stages was M. edulis less tolerant to low salinity stress than M. trossulus. Such difference suggests that selective mortality against M. edulis in early ontogenetic stages rather than post-settlement stage may be responsible for the persistence of a few pure M. trossulus populations along the Gasp{\'{e}} Peninsula. We also found that the ability to tolerate hyposalinity was weakened during the reproductive period, which indicates that salinity may also act as a selective factor in determining the abundance and size structure of wild mussel populations.},

abstract = {The blue mussels Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus occur sympatrically and are able to hybridize in populations on the eastern coast of Newfoundland, Canada, presenting an opportunity to study their aggregational behavior. Aggregation behavior may therefore provide insight into post-settlement interactions and pre-zygotic reproductive isolation between the species. Three treatments were designed using M. edulis and M. trossulus to investigate their intraspecific and interspecific spatial distribution patterns. With Ripley's K-function and Monte Carlo simulation analysis, we found that in the single-species treatment, M. edulis aggregated significantly but not M. trossulus. Based on results of two-way ANOVAs, both the number of aggregations and the moving distance were significantly affected by the treatments (single-species or mixed-species treatment) and times (24, 48, 72 and 96 h). In further pairwise comparisons using Tukey's test, M. edulis aggregated differently with or without M. trossulus occupying the same tank, suggesting that the aggregational behavior of M. edulis could be driven by species-specific chemical cues. The result that M. edulis aggregates intraspecifically may increase the probability of intraspecific fertilization of the spawned gametes and thus function as a pre-zygotic reproductive isolation mechanism maintaining the blue mussel hybrid zone.},

abstract = {While secondary contact between Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus in North America results in mosaic hybrid zone formation, both species form a hybrid swarm in the Baltic. Despite pervasive gene flow, Baltic Mytilus species maintain substantial genetic and phenotypic differentiation. Exploring mechanisms underlying the contrasting genetic composition in Baltic Mytilus species will allow insights into processes such as speciation or adaptation to extremely low salinity. Previous studies in the Baltic indicated that only weak interspecific reproductive barriers exist and discussed the putative role of adaptation to environmental conditions. Using a combination of hydrodynamic modelling and multilocus genotyping, we investigate how oceanographic conditions influence passive larval dispersal and hybrid swarm formation in the Baltic. By combining our analyses with previous knowledge, we show a genetic transition of Baltic Mytilus species along longitude 12°-13°E, that is a virtual line between Malm{\"{o}} (Sweden) and Stralsund (Germany). Although larval transport only occurs over short distances (10–30 km), limited larval dispersal could not explain the position of this genetic transition zone. Instead, the genetic transition zone is located at the area of maximum salinity change (15–10 psu). Thus, we argue that selection results in weak reproductive barriers and local adaptation. This scenario could maintain genetic and phenotypic differences between Baltic Mytilus species despite pervasive introgressive hybridization.},

abstract = {Large-scale climate changes influence the geographic distribution of biodiversity. Many taxa have been reported to extend or reduce their geographic range, move poleward or displace other species. However, for closely related species that can hybridize in the natural environment, displacement is not the only effect of changes of environmental variables. Another option is subtler, hidden expansion, which can be found using genetic methods only. The marine blue mussels Mytilus are known to change their geographic distribution despite being sessile animals. In addition to natural dissemination at larval phase—enhanced by intentional or accidental introductions and rafting—they can spread through hybridization and introgression with local congeners, which can create mixed populations sustaining in environmental conditions that are marginal for pure taxa. The Mytilus species have a wide distribution in coastal regions of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. In this study, we investigated the inter-regional genetic differentiation of the Mytilus species complex at 53 locations in the North Atlantic and adjacent Arctic waters and linked this genetic variability to key local environmental drivers. Of seventy-nine candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), all samples were successfully genotyped with a subset of 54 SNPs. There was a clear interregional separation of Mytilus species. However, all three Mytilus species hybridized in the contact area and created hybrid zones with mixed populations. Boosted regression trees (BRT) models showed that inter-regional variability was important in many allele models but did not prevail over variability in local environmental factors. Local environmental variables described over 40% of variability in about 30% of the allele frequencies of Mytilus spp. For the 30% of alleles, variability in their frequencies was only weakly coupled with local environmental conditions. For most studied alleles the linkages between environmental drivers and the genetic variability of Mytilus spp. were random in respect to "coding" and "non-coding" regions. An analysis of the subset of data involving functional genes only showed that two SNPs at Hsp70 and ATPase genes correlated with environmental variables. Total predictive ability of the highest performing models (r2 between 0.550 and 0.801) were for alleles that discriminated most effectively M. trossulus from M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis, whereas the best performing allele model (BM101A) did the best at discriminating M. galloprovincialis from M. edulis and M. trossulus. Among the local environmental variables, salinity, water temperature, ice cover and chlorophyll a concentration were by far the greatest predictors, but their predictive performance varied among different allele models. In most cases changes in the allele frequencies along these environmental gradients were abrupt and occurred at a very narrow range of environmental variables. In general, regions of change in allele frequencies for M. trossulus occurred at 8–11 psu, 0–10 °C, 60%–70% of ice cover and 0–2 mg m−3 of chlorophyll a, M. edulis at 8–11 and 30–35 psu, 10–14 °C and 60%–70% of ice cover and for M. galloprovincialis at 30–35 psu, 14–20 °C.},

abstract = {This study is the third in a series of papers on the Chupa Estuary, White Sea, Russia, and investigates tidal and seasonal fate and fluxes of materials from a small fjord-like Arctic estuary to the coastal zone. Respective companion papers have detailed the hydrography (Howland et al., 1999, Estuarine, Coastal Shelf Science, 48, 1-12) and metals in sediments and mussels (Millward et al., 1999, Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 48, 13-25). Two seasonal cruises were undertaken in summer (July 1994) and autumn (September, 1995). Nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and silicate) and dissolved oxygen were recorded along the estuarine longitudinal axis and at diurnal anchor stations at key points in the estuary. The fluvial nutrient input was negligible throughout. Nutrient concentrations showed considerable inter-tidal and spring-neap variability. Evidence from isopycnals showed that this variability is related to water exchange processes in the deep basins where renewal takes place within the space of a tidal cycle. Deep-water renewal and cascading is more pronounced on neap tides due to reduced turbulent mixing. The downwelling of seawater ensures that the deep basin waters are well ventilated, and provides a means of coupling between bottom and surface water nutrient pools whereby remineralized nutrients are dispersed and recirculated. Nutrient fluxes to the coastal zone were quantified in autumn as a net import of DSi and DIP at 2.10 and 0.51 mols-1, respectively, and a DIN export of 1.72 mols-1. In July DIN, DIP and DSi were exported at 3.57, 0.41 and 7.04 mols-1, respectively. An assessment of hydrodynamical parameters shows that the circulation is complex throughout the estuary, and so the resolved fluxes are semi-quantitative. Fjord-like circulation results in a large export of inorganic nutrients in the lower nutrient rich layers compared to the incoming intermediate layers, which drives the system towards N-limitation in both summer and autumn, thus lending support to the concept of N-limiting tendencies observed in other sub-Arctic areas. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Species were distinguished with polymerase chain reaction amplification using a diagnostic DNA marker (Glu-5). Relative frequencies of each species showed no clear patterns of distribution with wave exposure or tidal height.

abstract = {Mussels belonging to the Mytilus species complex (M. edulis, ME; M. galloprovincialis, MG; and M. trossulus, MT) often occur in sympatry, facilitating introgressive hybridization. This may be further promoted by mussel aquaculture practices, with MT introgression often resulting in commercially unfavourable traits such as low meat yield and weak shells. To investigate the relationship between genotype and shell phenotype, genetic and morphological variability was quantified across depth (1 m to 7 m) along a cultivation rope at a mussel farm on the West coast of Scotland. A single nuclear marker (Me15/16) and a novel panel of 33 MT-diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to evaluate stock structure and the extent of MT introgression across depth. Variation in shell strength, determined as the maximum compression force for shell puncture, and shell shape using geometric morphometric analysis were evaluated in relation to cultivation depth and the genetic profiles of the mussels. Overall, ME was the dominant genotype across depth, followed by ME × MG hybrids and smaller quantities of ME × MT hybrids and pure MT individuals. In parallel, we identified multiple individuals that were either predominantly homozygous or heterozygous for MT-diagnostic alleles, likely representing pure MT and first-generation ME × MT hybrids, respectively. Both the proportion of individuals carrying MT alleles and MT allele frequency declined with depth. Furthermore, MT-introgressed individuals had significantly weaker and more elongate shells than nonintrogressed individuals. This study provides detailed insights into stock structure along a cultivation rope and suggests that practical methods to assess shell strength and shape of cultivated mussels may facilitate the rapid identification of MT, limiting the impact of this commercially damaging species.},

We employed two experimental treatments, "coastal" (natural, unfiltered coastal seawater pumped directly into the laboratory) and "estuarine" (natural, unfiltered freshwater from a nearby pond added to ambient sea water), and for both treatments we measured temperature, salinity, total particulate matter (TPM mg 1-1), and particulate organic matter (POM mg 1-1). We compared the mortality rate, energy acquisition, biochemical composition and specific growth rate (SGR) of M. edulis, M. trossulus and their hybrids under both sets of experimental conditions. Under coastal conditions, mussels from two sites (Bellevue, an open coast, non-estuarine site: Traytown, an estuarine site) exhibited mortality rates which were so low that they precluded meaningful statistical comparison. Under estuarine conditions, mortality occurred among M. trossulus mussels from both sites before it occurred among the M. edulis mussels. Consistent with the mortality data we also observed greater utilisation of non-protein energy reserves in M. trossulus than in M. edulis. Our data therefore do not support the hypothesis that M. trossulus is better adapted to estuarine conditions than is M. edulis. Although there was some limited evidence of taxon-specific effects for the other variables investigated (SGR, soft body C:N ratio, absolute C and N values ($\mu$g per mg dry body weight), weight standardised clearance rate (CRS) faecal production rate (mg dry weight day-1 and mg ash-free dry weight (AFDW) day-1), and absorption efficiency (AE)), these were almost completely obscured by the effects of the experimental treatment. We conclude that the lack of taxon-specific differences in physiological responses (SGR, CRS, faecal production rates, AE) indicates that the higher mortality rate of M. trossulus in the estuarine regime did not result from a reduction in energy intake. This interpretation is consistent with findings for the same taxa from northern Europe, and suggests that other factors at the cellular or biochemical levels (for example, a failure to control intracellular ionic balance) warrant attention as possible explanations for ecological differences between the two hybridising taxa. We suggest that detailed study of the micro-scale distributions of these mussels is required to examine further the influence of low salinity, and associated environmental variability, on the geographic distributions of both taxa and their hybrids in Atlantic Canada. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Cryptic and hybridizing species may lack diagnostic taxonomic characters leaving researchers with semi-diagnostic ones. Identification based on such characters is probabilistic, the probability of correct identification depending on the species composition in a mixed population. Here we test the possibilities of applying a semi-diagnostic conchological character for distinguishing two cryptic species of blue mussels, Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus. These ecologically, stratigraphically and economically important molluscs co-occur and hybridize in many areas of the North Atlantic and the neighboring Arctic. Any cues for distinguishing them in sympatry without genotyping would save much research effort. Recently these species have been shown to statistically differ in the White Sea, where a simple character of the shell was used to distinguish two mussel morphotypes. In this paper, we analyzed the associations between morphotypes and species-specific genotypes based on an abundant material from the waters of the Kola Peninsula (White Sea, Barents Sea) and a more limited material from Norway, the Baltic Sea, Scotland and the Gulf of Maine. The performance of the “morphotype test” for species identification was formally evaluated using approaches from evidence-based medicine. Interspecific differences in the morphotype frequencies were ubiquitous and unidirectional, but their scale varied geographically (from 75% in the White Sea to 15% in the Baltic Sea). In addition, salinity-related variation of this character within M. edulis was revealed in the Arctic Barents Sea. For every studied region, we established relationships between the proportions of the morphotypes in the populations as well as between the proportions of the morphotypes in samples and the probabilities of mussels of different morphotypes being M. trossulus and M. edulis. We provide recommendations for the application of the morphotype test to mussels from unstudied contact zones and note that they may apply equally well to other taxa identified by semi-diagnostic traits.},

At each sampling time, the bioaccumulation of PACs, lipid content and condition indices were higher whithin Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus displaying shorter survival than at the other sites. M. edulis was generally more tolerant than M. trossulus (for n=11, LT50 of 9.3 and 7.9 days), with indications of shorter and later gonad development in M. trossulus. Minimum and maximum tolerance was apparent in June and October (LT50 spanning 3-14 days), respectively.

abstract = {Mussels of the genus Mytilus have been used to assess the circumglacial phylogeography of the intertidal zone. These mussels are representative components of the intertidal zone and have rapidly evolving mitochondrial DNA, suitable for high resolution phylogeographic analyses. In Europe, the three Mytilus species currently share mitochondrial haplotypes, owing to the cases of extensive genetic introgression. Genetic diversity of Mytilus edulis, Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis was studied using a 900-bp long part of the most variable fragment of the control region from one of their two mitochondrial genomes. To this end, 985 specimens were sampled along the European coasts, at sites ranging from the Black Sea to the White Sea. The relevant DNA fragments were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. Contrary to the earlier findings, our coalescence and nested cladistics results show that only a single M. edulis glacial refugium existed in the Atlantic. Despite that, the species survived the glaciation retaining much of its diversity. Unsurprisingly, M. galloprovincialis survived in the Mediterranean Sea. In a relatively short time period, around the climatic optimum at 10 ky ago, the species underwent rapid expansion coupled with population differentiation. Following the expansion, further contemporary gene flow between populations was limited.},

abstract = {Geographic range differences among species may result from differences in their physiological tolerances. In the intertidal zone, marine and terrestrial environments intersect to create a unique habitat, across which physiological tolerance strongly influences range. Traits to cope with environmental extremes are particularly important here because many species live near their physiological limits and environmental gradients can be steep. The snail Melampus bidentatus occurs in coastal salt marshes in the western Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. We used sequence data from one mitochondrial (COI) and two nuclear markers (histone H3 and a mitochondrial carrier protein, MCP) to identify three cryptic species within this broad-ranging nominal species, two of which have partially overlapping geographic ranges. High genetic diversity, low population structure, and high levels of migration within these two overlapping species suggest that historical range limitations do not entirely explain their different ranges. To identify microhabitat differences between these two species, we modelled their distributions using data from both marine and terrestrial environments. Although temperature was the largest factor setting range limits, other environmental components explained features of the ranges that temperature alone could not. In particular, the interaction of precipitation and salinity likely sets physiological limits that lead to range differences between these two cryptic species. This suggests that the response to climatic change in these snails will be mediated by changes to multiple environmental factors, and not just to temperature alone. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The novel machine learning technique Random Forest (RF) was used to test if the genetic differentiation of populations of marine species may be related to any of the key environmental variables known to shape species distributions. The study was performed in North and Baltic Sea characterized by strong gradients of environmental factors and almost continuous distributions of Mytilus mussel populations. Assessment of the species identity was performed using four nuclear DNA markers, and previously published single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. A general pattern of cline variation was observed with increasing Mytilus trossulus share towards the eastern Baltic Sea. Average allele share rose to 61% in H{\"{o}}ga Kusten, Gulf of Bothnia. All Baltic Sea samples revealed a strong introgression of Mytilus edulis and a limited introgression of M. trossulus through the Danish Straits. The studied environmental variables described 67 and 68% of the variability in the allele frequencies of M. edulis and M. trossulus. Salinity defined over 50% of the variability in the gene frequencies of the studied Mytilus spp. populations. Changes along this environmental gradient were not gradual but instead a significant shift from gene dominance was found at a salinity of 12 PSU. Water temperature and the trophic status of the sea area had only moderate association with the gene frequencies. The obtained results showed that the novel machine learning technique can be successfully used for finding correlations between genetic differentiation of populations and environmental variables and for defining the functional form of these linkages.},

abstract = {Dense beds of mussels of the family Mytilidae occur worldwide on soft-bottoms in cold and warm temperate coastal waters and have usually been considered hot spots of biodiversity. We examined intertidal mussel beds at four distant locations around the globe with the same sampling method, to find out whether this "hot spot" designation holds universally. We studied species assemblages within the matrices of byssally interconnected mussels engineered by Mytilus edulis in the North Sea, by mixed Perumytilus purpuratus and Mytilus chilensis at the southern Chilean coast, by Musculista senhousia in the Yellow Sea and by Xenostrobus inconstans at the coast of southern Australia. In all cases, species assemblages inside mussel beds were significantly different from those outside with many species being restricted to one habitat type. However, species richness and diversity were not generally higher in mussel beds than in ambient sediments without mussels. In the North Sea (M. edulis) and at the Chilean coast (P. purpuratus, M. chilensis), mussel beds have markedly higher species numbers and diversities than surrounding sediments, but this was not the case for mussel beds in Australia (X. inconstans) and the Yellow Sea (M. senhousia) where numbers of associated species were only slightly higher and somewhat lower than in adjacent sediments, respectively. In conclusion, although soft bottom mytilid mussels generally enhance habitat heterogeneity and species diversity at the ecosystem level, mussel beds themselves are not universal centres of biodiversity, but the effects on associated species are site specific.},

abstract = {Baltic blue mussels can colonise and dominate habitats with far lower salinity (<10 psu) than other Mytilus congeners. Pervasive gene flow was observed between Western Baltic Mytilus edulis living at high salinity conditions and Eastern Baltic M. trossulus living at lower salinites, with highest admixture proportions within a genetic transition zone located at intermediate salinities (Darss Sill area). Yet, we do not understand the impacts of low salinity on larval performance, and how salinity may act as an early selective pressure during passive larval drift across salinity gradients. This study tested whether larvae originating from two different populations along the natural salinity cline in the Baltic Sea have highest fitness at their native salinities. Our results suggest that Eastern Baltic M. trossulus (Usedom, 7 psu) and Western Baltic M. edulis (Kiel, 16 psu) larvae display better performance (fitness components: growth, mortality, settlement success) when reared at their respective native salinities. This suggests that these populations are adapted to their local environment. Additionally, species diagnostic markers were used for genetic analyses of transition zone (Ahrenshoop, 11 psu) mussel larvae exposed to low salinity. This revealed that low salinity selection resulted in a shift towards allele frequencies more typical for Eastern Baltic M. trossulus. Thus, salinity acts as a selective pressure during the pre-settlement phase and can shape the genetic composition of Baltic mussel populations driving local adaptation to low salinity. Future climate change driven desalination, therefore, has the potential to shift the Baltic Sea hybrid gradient westward with consequences for benthic ecosystem structure.},

abstract = {Cryptic mussel species Mytilus edulis (Me) and M.trossulus (Mt) form mixed settlements in shallow waters of the White Sea. The proportion of Mt and Me in local settlements varies in broad limits but the factors regulating taxonomic composition of mixed populations are poorly understood. Present study focuses on the assessment of the sea star (Asterias rubens) predation influence on the Mt-Me ratio in natural habitats. For this purpose, we've conducted a series of field experiments. For mussels placed on experimental units (ceramic plates submerged in starfish-infested habitats), we've estimated a probability of being eaten by starfish. We've constructed a linear model that includes several predictors which may influence the probability of being eaten (starfish biomass, mussel size, mussel species, prey abundance, Mt-Me ratio on experimental units and abundance of conspecifics). The analysis has revealed that the probability of being eaten expectedly increases with sea stars' biomass increasing, but it is higher for Mt in comparison with Me. This indicates Mt as a preferable prey. Negative correlations between the probability of being eaten and shell size, number of conspecifics and mussel abundance were also revealed. No significant dependence on Mt-Me ratio was found. Additionally, we've taken field samples which revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of Mt in mussel patches after a massive starfish attack. This indicates that starfish ate out Mt as its preferable prey. These results show that predators can contribute to the regulation of taxonomic composition of mixed Mt-Me settlements in the White Sea.},

There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.

abstract = {Non-indigenous species (NIS) pose a major threat to biodiversity and the functioning and services of ecosystems. Despite their rapid spread in coastal waters worldwide, biotic invasions are widely disregarded in marine conservation planning. To guide conservation actions, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms determining the success of NIS are therefore needed. Here we develop a combined modelling approach to identify the key drivers and community assembly processes determining the occurrence of invasive benthic invertebrates, using Danish coastal waters as a case study. To reflect factors affecting the introduction, establishment and spread of NIS throughout the area, we compiled long-term monitoring data on NIS, as well as information on commercial shipping, environmental conditions and estimates of larvae settling densities derived from drift model simulations informed by species traits. We then applied a set of species distribution models to identify the key drivers determining the occurrence of NIS. Our results demonstrate a significant positive effect of vessel activity, a negative effect of depth and bottom salinity, as well as a positive effect of the simulated settling densities on the probability of presence. Taken together, our results highlight the role of commercial shipping, habitat characteristics and passive advection of early-life stages on the presence of NIS. Our combined modelling approach provide improved process understanding on the key community assembly processes determining the presence of NIS and may serve to guide monitoring, management and conservation planning in order to limit future invasions and their negative consequences on coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Few marine hybrid zones have been studied extensively, the major exception being the hybrid zone between the mussels Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis in southwestern Europe. Here, we focus on two less studied hybrid zones that also involve Mytilus spp.; Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus are sympatric and hybridize on both western and eastern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean. We review the dynamics of hybridization in these two hybrid zones and evaluate the role of local adaptation for maintaining species boundaries. In Scandinavia, hybridization and gene introgression is so extensive that no individuals with pure M. trossulus genotypes have been found. However, M. trossulus alleles are maintained at high frequencies in the extremely low salinity Baltic Sea for some allozyme genes. A synthesis of reciprocal transplantation experiments between different salinity regimes shows that unlinked Gpi and Pgm alleles change frequency following transplantation, such that post-transplantation allelic composition resembles native populations found in the same salinity. These experiments provide strong evidence for salinity adaptation at Gpi and Pgm (or genes linked to them). In the Canadian Maritimes, pure M. edulis and M. trossulus individuals are abundant, and limited data suggest that M. edulis predominates in low salinity and sheltered conditions, whereas M. trossulus are more abundant on the wave-exposed open coasts. We suggest that these conflicting patterns of species segregation are, in part, caused by local adaptation of Scandinavian M. trossulus to the extremely low salinity Baltic Sea environment.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied to predict the distribution of benthic species in the North Sea. An understanding of species distribution patterns is essential to gain insight into ecological processes in marine ecosystems and to guide ecosystem management strategies. Therefore, we compared 9 different SDM methods, including GLM, GBM, FDA, SVM, RF, MAXENT, BIOCLIM, GARP and MARS, by using 10 environmental variables to model the distribution of 20 marine benthic species. Most of the models showed good or very good performance in terms of predictive power and accuracy, with highest mean area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.845 and 0.840, obtained for the MAXENT and GBM models, respectively. The poorest performance was shown by the BIOCLIM model, which had a mean AUC of 0.708. Nevertheless, the mapped distribution patterns varied remarkably depending on the model used, with up to 32.5% differences in predictions between models. For species with a narrow distribution range, the models showed a better performance based on the AUC than for species with a broad distribution range, which can most likely be attributed to the restricted spatial scale and the model evaluation procedure. Of the environmental variables, bottom water temperature and depth had the greatest effect on the distribution of 14 benthic species, based on MAXENT results. We examine the potential utility of this strategy for predicting future distribution of benthic species in response to climate change. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation techniques are commonly used to describe genetic and ecological patterns. To improve statistical inference about spatial covariance, we propose a continuous nonparametric estimator of the covariance function in place of the spatial correlogram. The spline correlogram is an adaptation of a recent development in spatial statistics and is a generalization of the commonly used correlogram. We propose a bootstrap algorithm to erect a confidence envelope around the entire covariance function. The meaning of this envelope is discussed. Not all functions that can be drawn inside the envelope are candidate covariance functions, as they may not be positive semidefinite. However, covariance functions that do not fit, are not supported by the data. A direct estimate of the L0 spatial correlation length with associated confidence interval is offered and its interpretation is discussed. The spline correlogram is found to have high precision when applied to synthetic data. For illustration, the method is applied to electrophoretic data of an alpine grass (Pou alpina).},

In mixed experimental stocks, the odds of being eaten by sea stars were about four times greater for M. trossulus. We also showed that A. rubens preferred smaller mussels to larger ones, irrespective of their species affinity. Our findings support earlier indirect observations showing that sea stars recognize M. trossulus as a more preferable prey than M. edulis. Dramatic differences in the vulnerability to sea star predation may explain the segregation of habitats between the two mussel species in contact zones; M. trossulus usually tends to occupy habitats where the sea star predators are scarce.},

abstract = {Two blue mussel lineages of Pliocene origin, Mytilus edulis (ME) and M. trossulus (MT), co-occur and hybridize in several regions on the shores of the North Atlantic. The two species were distinguished from each other by molecular methods in the 1980s, and a large amount of comparative data on them has been accumulated since that time. However, while ME and MT are now routinely distinguished by various genetic markers, they tend to be overlooked in ecological studies since morphological characters for taxonomic identification have been lacking, and no consistent habitat differences between lineages have been reported. Surveying a recently discovered area of ME and MT co-occurrence in the White Sea and employing a set of allozyme markers for identification, we address the issue whether ME and MT are true biological species with distinct ecological characteristics or just virtual genetic entities with no matching morphological and ecological identities. We find that: (1) in the White Sea, the occurrence of MT is largely concentrated in harbors, in line with observations from other subarctic regions of Europe; (2) mixed populations of ME and MT are always dominated by purebred individuals, animals classified as hybrids constituting only ca. 18%; (3) in terms of shell morphology, 80% of MT bear a distinct uninterrupted dark prismatic strip under the ligament while 97% of ME lack this character; (4) at sites of sympatry MT is more common on algal substrates while ME mostly lives directly on the bottom. This segregation by the substrate may contribute to maintaining reproductive isolation and decreasing competition between taxa. We conclude that while ME and MT are not fully reproductively isolated, they do represent clearly distinguishable biological, ecological and morphological entities in the White Sea. It remains to be documented whether the observed morphological and ecological differences are of a local character, or whether they have simply been overlooked in other contact zones.},

abstract = {Mytilus trossulus Gould and M. edulis L. coexist in mixed populations in Atlantic Canadian waters. Although there is evidence that the two species hybridize in natural populations and that hybrids produce progeny through backcrosses, no study of the microgeographic distribution of the two forms and their hybrids has been made. Here we examine subtidal samples of mussels taken in July 1997 from two locations in eastern Newfoundland (Canada) and from wave-exposed and protected environments within each location. Shell lengths ranged from 15 to about 90 mm. Mussels were classified as pure forms or hybrids (F1, F2 and from backcrosses) based on four diagnostic markers, two allozyme loci (Mpi and Est-D) and two nuclear PCR-based DNA markers (ITS and Glu-5). In addition, a PCR-based mtDNA marker (COIII) was used to characterize the distribution of mtDNA mitotypes among pure and hybrid individuals. There were differences in the proportions of pure M. edulis and M. trossulus between sites and between environments at one location. M. trossulus was the predominant species at one of the two exposed sites. In all four samples, M. trossulus was also the predominant form among small individuals. The frequency of hybrids was 26% overall and did not differ among samples. Hybrids consisted mostly of backcrosses that were M. trossulus-biased among small mussels and M. edulis-biased among large ones. We conclude that both intrinsic genetic factors and extrinsic environmental factors influence the relative frequency of M. edulis, M. trossulus and their hybrids.},

abstract = {To develop more reliable marine species distribution models (SDMs), we examine how genetic, climatic, and biotic interaction gradients give rise to prediction error in marine SDM. Genetic lineages with distinct ecological requirements spanning genetic gradients have yet to be treated separately in marine SDM, which are often constrained to modeling the potential distribution of one biological unit (e.g. lineage or species) at a time. By comparing SDM performance for the whole species or where observation and predictions were partitioned among geographically discontinuous genetic lineages, we first identified the appropriate biological unit for modeling sea scallop. Prediction errors, in particular contiguous omissions at the northern range margins were effectively halved in genetic lineage SDM (Total error=15%) verses whole species SDM. Remaining SDM prediction error was strongly associated with: i) Sharp climatic gradients (abrupt and persistent spatial shifts in limiting temperatures) found within continental shelf breaks and bottom channels. ii) A biotic gradient in the predation of sea scallop juveniles by the sand star within the Hudson Shelf USA. Our findings highlight how the accuracy of marine SDM is dependent on capturing the appropriate biological unit for modeling (e.g. lineages rather than species) and adequately resolving limiting abiotic and biotic interaction gradients.},

@article{Peterson2019,
abstract = {Populations of many species are genetically adapted to local historical climate conditions. Yet most forecasts of species' distributions under climate change have ignored local adaptation (LA), which may paint a false picture of how species will respond across their geographic ranges. We review recent studies that have incorporated intraspecific variation, a potential proxy for LA, into distribution forecasts, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and make recommendations for how to improve forecasts in the face of LA. The three methods used so far (species distribution models, response functions, and mechanistic models) reflect a trade-off between data availability and the ability to rigorously demonstrate LA to climate. We identify key considerations for incorporating LA into distribution forecasts that are currently missing from many published studies, including testing the spatial scale and pattern of LA, the confounding effects of LA to nonclimatic or biotic drivers, and the need to incorporate empirically based dispersal or gene flow processes. We suggest approaches to better evaluate these aspects of LA and their effects on species-level forecasts. In particular, we highlight demographic and dynamic evolutionary models as promising approaches to better integrate LA into forecasts, and emphasize the importance of independent model validation. Finally, we urge closer examination of how LA will alter the responses of central vs. marginal populations to allow stronger generalizations about changes in distribution and abundance in the face of LA.},

abstract = {Subarctic populations of “cryptic” blue mussel species Mytilus edulis (ME) and M. trossulus (MT) are less studied than Arctic and boreal populations. Ecological features of ME and MT in sympatry are poorly known everywhere. We studied the habitat segregation of ME and MT and the interannual dynamics of their mixed settlements at the Murman coast of the Barents Sea, the northeastern boundary of the Atlantic littoral mussel communities. Previous data on mussels from this area are 50-100 years old. The 3-km-long Tyuva Inlet (Kola Bay) was used as the study site. Mussels were found in the littoral and the sublittoral down to a depth of 4 m. Their characteristic habitats were sandbanks, littoral rocks, sublittoral kelp forests and “the habitat of the mussel bed” in the freshened top of the inlet. The main spatial gradients explaining the variability of demographics of the settlements (abundance, age structure, size) were associated with the depth and the distance from the inlet top. ME and MT were partially segregated by depth: ME dominated in the sublittoral and MT, in the littoral. In addition, ME dominated throughout the mussel bed. The ratio of species in the mixed settlements varied over time: between 2004 and 2010 the proportions of MT decreased everywhere, by 22% on average. The habitat distribution of mussels apparently changed with time: we found that mussels were abundant in kelp forests, where they had rarely been observed in the 20th century. We suggest that the spatial and temporal dynamics of subarctic mussels can be partly explained by the competition between ME and MT and their differing sensitivity to environmental factors.},

abstract = {Three species of the mussel, Mytilus, occur in the North Atlantic region, M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus, and hybrid zones are present where their distributions overlap. M. edulis is a native species in the UK. M. galloprovincialis originated in the Mediterranean and its distribution extends northwards along the Atlantic seaboard to Scotland. Baltic Sea mussels have a M. trossulus ancestry but are highly introgressed by M. edulis. In recent decades, farming of mussels on long-line rope culture systems has been introduced into Scotland. On farms in Loch Etive, a form of mussel with a fragile shell and a different shape to either M. edulis or M. galloprovincialis has been increasing in frequency over recent years. Samples of fragile shelled, normal strong shelled and intermediate mussel types were sampled from two farms in 2006 and compared with samples of M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus from other sources where their species identity is well established. Abundance relative to depth, shell strength, condition index and shell morphology were analysed together with 5 allozyme loci and one nuclear DNA genetic marker (Me 15/16). The fragile shelled mussels, and many of those classed as intermediate, were identified as a mixture of M. trossulus and M. trossulus x M. edulis hybrids. This identification was strongly supported by both morphological and genetic data and is the first record of the presence of M. trossulus in UK waters. M. trossulus in Loch Etive are most likely to be a post-glacial relict population restricted to the low salinity area of the Loch that has recently increased in abundance due to commercial mussel growing activity. In addition, individual mussels of all three species and their hybrids were detected amongst Loch Etive mussels. This is the first genetic demonstration of all three species and their hybrids occurring together in one location in the Atlantic region and provides a unique opportunity to study the processes of speciation, divergence, and introgression in the genus Mytilus. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.
